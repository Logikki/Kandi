	abstract = {The reliability of electronics products has become a serious problem due to the increasingly harsh environmental conditions when the products are in use. Due to demand on greater performance and higher integration in microelectronic devices, the electronics industry has been seeking suitable components, packaging and cooling techniques to achieve low-cost and high-reliability. This paper presents the experimental verifications to analyze the effect of temperature and humidity on the electronic circuit as well as evaluating the device reliability, using Xiaomi Band 2 as a real case. It is found that 125°C has been a critical temperature for the smart watch, above which the sealed plastic case ruptured easily. However, 150°C has been found to be the temperature to burst the battery. Cold storage test with a temperature of - 70°C shows that low-temperature will only cause the smartwatch to hibernate, even for up to 400 hours, after which the device will be restored to work under a room temperature. Humidity has been found to be a crucial factor in damaging the device, which changes the rubber ring and plastic case into brittle and corrodes the interconnects on printed circuit board. Further investigation into the microstructure evolution of interconnects has found that the highly accelerated stress test has caused serious cracks in solder joints and electronic components, such as, resistors and capacitors. In short, the smartwatch can work under harsher environment than the designated environmental conditions in the product manual.},

This master’s thesis aims to find out how consumers use selftracking technology as part of everyday life. The study initially defines what is selfhood and self-tracking as well as attempts to define what is biohacking. The empirical part of the thesis interviews eight people, who each have been measuring their activities at least for two years. The interviews revealed that the available technology affects the measurable parameters. All interviewees had wearable activity meters. This meant that most measured parameters were exercise and sleep. The research goes through step by step how the subjects have domesticated self-tracking into their everyday life, while attempting to understand the motivations behind it. All interviewees were motivated by idea of improving their well-being. The most interesting part of the study is in detecting differences the beginning of their self-tracking journey. Some of the interviewees were checking their measurements constantly, while others did it only occasionally. But once they domesticated self-tracking as part of their daily routines, habits were quite similar with each other’s.},

Through the analysis of reflected LED light on the skin, heart rate measurement and arrhythmia detection can be performed. Given that melanin alters skin light absorption, this study seeks to summarize the accuracy of cardiac data from wrist-worn wearable devices for participants of varying skin tones. Methods We conducted a systematic review, searching Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane for original studies that stratified heart rate and rhythm data for consumer wearable technology according to participant race and/or skin tone. Results A total of 10 studies involving 469 participants met inclusion criteria. The frequency-weighted Fitzpatrick score for skin tone was reported in six studies (n = 293), with a mean participant score of 3.5 (range 1–6). Overall, four of the ten studies reported a significant reduction in accuracy of heart rate measurement with wearable devices in darker-skinned individuals, compared to participants with lighter skin tones. Four studies noted no effect of user skin tone on accuracy. The remaining two studies showed mixed results. Conclusions Preliminary evidence is inconclusive, but some studies suggest that wearable devices may be less accurate for detecting heart rate in participants with darker skin tones. Higher quality evidence is necessary, with larger sample sizes and more objective stratification of participants by skin tone, in order to characterize potential racial bias in consumer devices.},

	abstract = {A persistent problem with field devices lies in the quality of the data that is obtained through the device. Given that data accuracy, validity, and reliability is currently unknown, errors in the estimation of these variables are often prevalent. Wrist-based monitors may show convenience and comfort in comparison to chest-strap monitors and enable them to be largely used. The purpose of this project is to monitor and compare heart rate data through the use of the Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch Series 7, and Polar H-10 chest-strap monitor, in comparison with the gold-standard 12-lead ECG in collegiate level athletes and recreationally active college-age young adults. A single-session cross-sectional study design was implemented. Twenty-five college-age male athletes from the UTEP football team and 20 college-age recreationally trained young adults (n=20; 10 males and 10 females) were recruited for this study. UTEP football subjects were asked to walk (low), jog (moderate), and run (high) intensity at zero incline for 3 minutes at 3 mph, 6 mph, and 9 mph, respectively. Similarly, recreational athletes followed the same protocol except the speed set on the treadmill was lowered to walk (low), jog (moderate), and run (high) intensity at 2.5 mph, 5 mph, and 7.5 mph, respectively. Following the test, subjects were asked to continue walking on the treadmill for 3 minutes for recovery. High association and good to excellent agreement (r = 0.76-0.99, ICC2,k = 0.86-0.99) between ECG and Polar H-10 throughout all stages. However, there were moderate associations and good agreement at walk, jog, and run intensity between the ECG and apple watch 6 (r = 0.57-0.77, ICC2,k = 0.62-0.84), and ECG and Apple watch 7 (r = 0.42-0.74, ICC2,k = 0.49-0.85). These findings indicate that even though there is a good-excellent agreement between the Apple Watch and ECG the accuracy of the Apple Watch tends to diminish with an increase in intensity.},

	abstract = {Stress is an inherent part of the normal human experience. Although, for the most part, this stress response is advantageous, chronic, heightened, or inappropriate stress responses can have deleterious effects on the human body. It has been suggested that individuals who experience repeated or prolonged stress exhibit blunted biological stress responses when compared to the general population. Thus, when assessing whether a ubiquitous stress response exists, it is important to stratify based on resting levels in the absence of stress. Research has shown that stress that causes symptomatic responses requires early intervention in order to mitigate possible associated mental health decline and personal risks. Given this, real-time monitoring of stress may provide immediate biofeedback to the individual and allow for early self-intervention. This study aimed to determine if the change in heart rate variability could predict, in two different cohorts, the quality of response to acute stress when exposed to an acute stressor and, in turn, contribute to the development of a physiological algorithm for stress which could be utilized in future smartwatch technologies. This study also aimed to assess whether baseline stress levels may affect the changes seen in heart rate variability at baseline and following stress tasks. A total of 30 student doctor participants and 30 participants from the general population were recruited for the study. The Trier Stress Test was utilized to induce stress, with resting and stress phase ECGs recorded, as well as inter-second heart rate (recorded using a FitBit). Although the present study failed to identify ubiquitous patterns of HRV and HR changes during stress, it did identify novel changes in these parameters between resting and stress states. This study has shown that the utilization of HRV as a measure of stress should be calculated with consideration of resting (baseline) anxiety and stress states in order to ensure an accurate measure of the effects of additive acute stress.},

In recent years, the focus has shifted from revealing determinants of smartwatch adoption to understanding factors that cause long-term usage. Despite their importance for personal fitness, health monitoring, and for achieving health and fitness goals, extant research on the continuous use intention of smartwatches mostly disregards health and fitness factors. Grounding on self-determination theory, this study addresses this gap and investigates the impact of health and fitness as well as positive and negative emotional factors encouraging or impeding consumers to continuously use smartwatches. We build upon the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) and extend it with emotional (device annoyance and enjoyment) as well as health and fitness factors (goal pursuit motivation and self-quantification behavior). We use structural equation modeling to validate our model based on 335 responses from actual smartwatch users. Results prove the applicability of the ECM to the smartwatch context and highlight the importance of self-quantification as a focal construct for explaining goal pursuit motivation, perceived usefulness, confirmation and device annoyance. Further, we identify device annoyance as an important barrier to continuous smartwatch use. Based on our results, we finally derive implications for researchers and practitioners alike.},

In addition, the technology readiness and acceptance model (TRAM) will be used to investigate consumers’ intention to use sports wearable devices (for simplicity, sports wearable devices will be simplified to the term “sports wearables”).,Convenience sampling was conducted from Korean consumers (n=247). Data were analyzed by partial least squares–structural equation modeling using SmartPLS 3.0.,The results found that positive TR has a positive influence on perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU), and negative TR had a negative influence on PEOU and PU. PEOU had a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). Both PEOU and PU led to intention to use sports wearable devices. Also, the multi-group analysis found a positive correlation between TR and PEOU for especially male users.,The findings of this study provide a better understanding of consumers’ behavioral intent to use sports wearables. Particularly, it also provides evidence that the TRAM is an appropriate framework for predicting users’ intention to use sports wearables. This study also stresses the important role of TR in consumers’ psychological processes leading up to the actual use of novel sports wearables.},

In order to better understand this challenge, we analyzed 600 product reviews and conducted 24 interviews with tracking device users. In this paper, we describe what methods users used to assess accuracy of their tracking devices and identify seven problems they encountered. We found that differences in users' expectations, physical characteristics, types of activities and lifestyle led them to have different perceptions of the accuracy of their devices. With the absence of sound mental models and unclear understanding of the concepts of accuracy and experimental controls, users designed faulty tests and came to incorrect conclusions. We propose design recommendations to better support end-users' efforts to assess and improve the accuracy of their tracking devices as required to suit their individual characteristics and purposes.},

Among these, sport seems to be a promising domain in which Personal Informatics tools can support individuals in performing their activities and in achieving their situated goals. In this article, we conducted semi-structured interviews with amateur and elite athletes to explore what they seek in their trackers, how such instruments may impact on their “mind”, by affecting their motivation and attention during workouts and races, and how sports data are intertwined with other information pertaining to their lifestyle. On the basis of these findings we discussed three themes that may be relevant for Personal Informatics, also proposing a series of implications for design that may help researchers in designing self-tracking tools for sport.},

Older adults spend up to 75, on average, of their day sedentary, however little is known about interventions designed to decrease sitting time for this population.Methods A scoping review was conducted to broadly determine what is known about sedentary behaviour interventions for older adults. Electronic databases were searched for articles with eligibility criteria including: (1) interventions containing strategies to decrease sedentary behaviour, (2) adults ≥60 years of age, and (3) reported outcome measures related to sedentary behaviour.Results A total of 32 articles met the inclusion criteria. While methodological quality and intervention characteristics varied among the studies, the majority of interventions used a multi-component approach. Interventions involved a variety of behavioural change strategies with goal setting, information and self-monitoring the most frequently used. Of the 20 studies reporting results, 80 (n = 16) found at least one significant change in sedentary behaviour.Conclusion Findings from this scoping review suggest that sedentary behaviour can be reduced in community-dwelling older adults through multi-component targeted interventions. Future work is needed to examine sedentary behaviour interventions for adults {\textgreater}75 years and for persons living in long-term care institutions.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOlder adults spend up to 75 of their day sedentary and are at an increased risk for chronic conditions, functional limitations, and mortality.Multi-component sedentary behaviour interventions, such as education, physical activity, and activity monitoring should be implemented for older adults.When designing interventions, incorporating goal-setting, self-monitoring and other behaviour change strategies can reduce sitting time for older adults.},

	abstract = {Effective long-term treatments are needed to address the obesity epidemic. Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available, but it is unclear if these are effective at improving weight loss.To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (standard intervention), a technology-enhanced weight loss intervention (enhanced intervention) would result in greater weight loss.Randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and enrolling 471 adult participants between October 2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014.Participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity.The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake.Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to \&lt;40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9 nonwhite, 77.2\% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5\% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean baseline weight was 96.3 kg (95\% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95\% CI, 90.6-95.0). For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2 kg (95\% CI, 93.0-97.3) and 24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95\% CI, 87.1-91.5). Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95\% CI, 2.6-4.5\vphantom{\{}\} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95\% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95\% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups.Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01131871},

	abstract = {Background
Elite athletes and recreational runners rely on the accuracy of global navigation satellite system (GNSS)–enabled sport watches to monitor and regulate training activities. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding the accuracy of such sport watches.

Objective
The aim was to investigate the accuracy of the recorded distances obtained by eight commercially available sport watches by Apple, Coros, Garmin, Polar, and Suunto when assessed in different areas and at different speeds. Furthermore, potential parameters that affect the measurement quality were evaluated.

Methods
Altogether, 3 × 12 measurements in urban, forest, and track and field areas were obtained while walking, running, and cycling under various outdoor conditions.

Results
The selected reference distances ranged from 404.0 m to 4296.9 m. For all the measurement areas combined, the recorded systematic errors (±limits of agreements) ranged between 3.7 (±195.6) m and –101.0 (±231.3) m, and the mean absolute percentage errors ranged from 3.2\% to 6.1\%. Only the GNSS receivers from Polar showed overall errors {\textless}5\%. Generally, the recorded distances were significantly underestimated (all P values {\textless}.04) and less accurate in the urban and forest areas, whereas they were overestimated but with good accuracy in 75\% (6/8) of the sport watches in the track and field area. Furthermore, the data assessed during running showed significantly higher error rates in most devices compared with the walking and cycling activities.

Conclusions
The recorded distances might be underestimated by up to 9\%. However, the use of all investigated sport watches can be recommended, especially for distance recordings in open areas.},

	abstract = {Elevation gain (EG) is a significant contributor to the total workload in many endurance sports. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of elevation recording as assessed by popular sport watches. Eighteen participants walked and ran at different speeds in various weather conditions in two terrain types: on a hilly 2490 m course with a total EG of 90 m and on a flat 1200 m outdoor track with 0 m EG. In total, 180 recordings from each sport watch were analyzed and compared according to two processing types: filtered and unfiltered EG data. Compared to the reference values, regarding default settings, on hilly terrain, EG was underestimated by −3.3 to −9.8 \%, and on flat terrain, EG was overestimated by 0.0–4.8 m per 1200 m. These errors could be reduced to −3.3 to +0.4 \%, when filtering conditions were adjusted according to the terrain. Gait speed (ranging from 1.47 to 4.89 m s−1) or fluctuations in weather conditions between- or within-trials did not influence EG accuracy. A straightforward comparison between manufacturers is hampered as the filter conditions set by default differ. In conclusion, all devices measure EG adequately; however, the displayed default feedback on EG data is not always the most accurate measurement. Consequently, accuracy in elevation recordings could be increased if users appropriately post-process EG data.},

Along with being an integral part of the recovery and adaptive process between bouts of exercise, accumulating evidence suggests that increased sleep duration and improved sleep quality in athletes are associated with improved performance and competitive success. In addition, better sleep may reduce the risk of both injury and illness in athletes, not only optimizing health but also potentially enhancing performance through increased participation in training. Despite this, most studies have found that athletes fail to obtain the recommended amount of sleep, threatening both performance and health. Athletes face a number of obstacles that can reduce the likelihood of obtaining proper sleep, such as training and competition schedules, travel, stress, academic demands, and overtraining. In addition, athletes have been found to demonstrate poor self-assessment of their sleep duration and quality. In light of this, athletes may require more careful monitoring and intervention to identify individuals at risk and promote proper sleep to improve both performance and overall health. This review attempts to highlight the recent literature regarding sleep issues in athletes, the effects of sleep on athletic performance, and interventions to enhance proper sleep in athletes.},

The algorithm is based on the particle filter and uses different data sources: a GPS receiver, inertial sensors, probability maps and a stereo camera. Inertial sensors are used to estimate a relative displacement of a pedestrian. A gyroscope estimates a change in the heading direction. An accelerometer is used to count a pedestrian’s steps and their lengths. The so-called probability maps help to limit GPS inaccuracy by imposing constraints on pedestrian kinematics, e.g., it is assumed that a pedestrian cannot cross buildings, fences etc. This limits position inaccuracy to ca. 10 m. Incorporation of depth estimates derived from a stereo camera that are compared to the 3D model of an environment has enabled further reduction of positioning errors. As a result, for 90\% of the time, the algorithm is able to estimate a pedestrian location with an error smaller than 2 m, compared to an error of 6.5 m for a navigation based solely on GPS.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to examine the RR interval signal qualities of a Holter device and a heart rate chest belt monitor at rest and during exercise. Ten healthy individuals completed five low- to high-intensity activities while simultaneously using the medilog® AR12plus  Holter monitor and the Polar H10 heart rate monitor. The RR interval signal quality was based on the quantification of the missing RR intervals and RR interval detection errors. Therefore, both measurement systems were compared against visual inspection of the raw electrocardiography signal. The missing and wrong R-wave peak detections were counted manually for both measurement systems. RR interval signal quality was defined as the relative number of correctly detected RR intervals. Overall, RR interval signal qualities of 94.6\% and 99.6\% were demonstrated for the medilog® AR12plus  and the Polar H10. During the high-intensity activities, the RR interval signal quality of the medilog® AR12plus  dropped to 89.8\%, whereas the Polar H10 maintained a signal quality of 99.4\%. The correlation between both systems was high (r = 0.997, p {\textgreater} 0.001). The excellent RR interval signal quality during low- to moderate-intensity activities in the medilog® AR12plus  and during low- to high-intensity activities in the Polar H10 demonstrates both measurement systems’ validity for the detection of RR intervals throughout a wide range of activities. A simple chest strap such as the Polar H10 might be recommended as the gold standard for RR interval assessments if intense activities with strong body movements are investigated.},

	abstract = {Background: Wrist-worn smart watches and fitness monitors (ie, wearables) have become widely adopted by consumers and are gaining increased attention from researchers for their potential contribution to naturalistic digital measurement of health in a scalable, mobile, and unobtrusive way. Various studies have examined the accuracy of these devices in controlled laboratory settings (eg, treadmill and stationary bike); however, no studies have investigated the heart rate accuracy of wearables during a continuous and ecologically valid 24-hour period of actual consumer device use conditions. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the heart rate accuracy of 2 popular wearable devices, the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2, as compared with the gold standard reference method, an ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), during consumer device use conditions in an individual. Data were collected across 5 daily conditions, including sitting, walking, running, activities of daily living (ADL; eg, chores, brushing teeth), and sleeping. Methods: One participant, (first author; 29-year-old Caucasian male) completed a 24-hour ecologically valid protocol by wearing 2 popular wrist wearable devices (Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2). In addition, an ambulatory ECG (Vrije Universiteit Ambulatory Monitoring System) was used as the gold standard reference method, which resulted in the collection of 102,740 individual heartbeats. A single-subject design was used to keep all variables constant except for wearable devices while providing a rapid response design to provide initial assessment of wearable accuracy for allowing the research cycle to keep pace with technological advancements. Accuracy of these devices compared with the gold standard ECG was assessed using mean error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percent error. These data were supplemented with Bland-Altman analyses and concordance class correlation to assess agreement between devices. Results: The Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2 were generally highly accurate across the 24-hour condition. Specifically, the Apple Watch 3 had a mean difference of −1.80 beats per minute (bpm), a mean absolute error percent of 5.86\%, and a mean agreement of 95\% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. The Fitbit Charge 2 had a mean difference of −3.47 bpm, a mean absolute error of 5.96\%, and a mean agreement of 91\% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. These findings varied by condition. Conclusions: The Apple Watch 3 and the Fitbit Charge 2 provided acceptable heart rate accuracy ({\textless}±10\%) across the 24 hour and during each activity, except for the Apple Watch 3 during the daily activities condition. Overall, these findings provide preliminary support that these devices appear to be useful for implementing ambulatory measurement of cardiac activity in research studies, especially those where the specific advantages of these methods (eg, scalability, low participant burden) are particularly suited to the population or research question.},

Once all devices were on, they were asked to run at the following speeds on a treadmill (in mph): 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for two min. HR was assessed on all devices and agreement among measurements determined with Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) (rc). The Polar H7 chest strap had the greatest agreement with the ECG (rc=98). This was followed by the Apple Watch III (rc=96). The Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, and Tom Tom Spark 3 all had the same level of agreement (rc=89). The Polar H7 chest strap was the most accurate, and the Apple Watch was superior among watches.

Sleep and HR measures were compared between FitbitChargeHR™ and PSG using paired t-tests and Bland-Altman plots. Epoch-by-epoch analysis showed that FitbitChargeHR™ had high overall accuracy (91\%), high sensitivity (97\%) in detecting sleep, and poor specificity (42\%) in detecting wake on a min-to-min basis.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the validity of the latest consumer sleep tracking devices including an activity wristband Fitbit Charge 2 and a wearable EEG-based eye mask Neuroon in comparison to a medical sleep monitor. First, we confirmed that Fitbit Charge 2 can automatically detect the onset and offset of sleep with reasonable accuracy. Second, analysis found that both consumer devices produced comparable results in measuring total sleep duration and sleep efficiency compared to the medical device. In addition, Fitbit accurately measured the number of awakenings, while Neuroon with good signal quality had satisfactory performance on total awake time and sleep onset latency. However, measuring sleep structure including light, deep, and REM sleep remains to be challenging for both consumer devices. Third, greater discrepancies were observed between Neuroon and the medical device in nights with more disrupted sleep and when the signal quality was poor, but no trend was observed in Fitbit Charge 2. This study suggests that current consumer sleep tracking technologies may be immature for diagnosing sleep disorders, but they are reasonably satisfactory for general purpose and non-clinical use.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Commercial wearable sleep-tracking devices are growing in popularity and in recent studies have performed well against gold standard sleep measurement techniques. However, most studies were conducted in controlled laboratory conditions. We therefore aimed to test the performance of devices under naturalistic unrestricted home sleep conditions.

Participants and Methods
Healthy young adults (n = 21; 12 women, 9 men; 29.0 ± 5.0 years, mean ± SD) slept at home under unrestricted conditions for 1 week using a set of commercial wearable sleep-tracking devices and completed daily sleep diaries. Devices included the Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Inspire HR, Oura ring, and Polar Vantage V Titan. Participants also wore a research-grade actigraphy watch (Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2) for comparison. To assess performance, all devices were compared with a high performing mobile sleep electroencephalography headband device (Dreem 2). Analyses included epoch-by-epoch and sleep summary agreement comparisons.

Results
Devices accurately tracked sleep-wake summary metrics (ie, time in bed, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset) on most nights but performed best on nights with higher sleep efficiency. Epoch-by-epoch sensitivity (for sleep) and specificity (for wake), respectively, were as follows: Actiwatch (0.95, 0.35), Fatigue Science (0.94, 0.40), Fitbit (0.93, 0.45), Oura (0.94, 0.41), and Polar (0.96, 0.35). Sleep stage-tracking performance was mixed, with high variability.

Conclusion
As in previous studies, all devices were better at detecting sleep than wake, and most devices compared favorably to actigraphy in wake detection. Devices performed best on nights with more consolidated sleep patterns. Unrestricted sleep TIB differences were accurately tracked on most nights. High variability in sleep stage-tracking performance suggests that these devices, in their current form, are still best utilized for tracking sleep-wake outcomes and not sleep stages. Most commercial wearables exhibited promising performance for tracking sleep-wake in real-world conditions, further supporting their consideration as an alternative to actigraphy.},

The secondary aim was to examine the validity of the six devices for assessing heart rate and heart rate variability during, or just prior to, night-time sleep. Fifty-three adults (26 F, 27 M, aged 25.4 ± 5.9 years) spent a single night in a sleep laboratory with 9 h in bed (23:00–08:00 h). Participants were fitted with all six wearable devices—and with polysomnography and electrocardiography for gold-standard assessment of sleep and heart rate, respectively. Compared with polysomnography, agreement (and Cohen’s kappa) for two-state categorisation of sleep periods (as sleep or wake) was 88\% (κ = 0.30) for Apple Watch; 89\% (κ = 0.35) for Garmin; 87\% (κ = 0.44) for Polar; 89\% (κ = 0.51) for Oura; 86\% (κ = 0.44) for WHOOP and 87\% (κ = 0.48) for Somfit. Compared with polysomnography, agreement (and Cohen’s kappa) for multi-state categorisation of sleep periods (as a specific sleep stage or wake) was 53\% (κ = 0.20) for Apple Watch; 50\% (κ = 0.25) for Garmin; 51\% (κ = 0.28) for Polar; 61\% (κ = 0.43) for Oura; 60\% (κ = 0.44) for WHOOP and 65\% (κ = 0.52) for Somfit. Analyses regarding the two-state categorisation of sleep indicate that all six devices are valid for the field-based assessment of the timing and duration of sleep. However, analyses regarding the multi-state categorisation of sleep indicate that all six devices require improvement for the assessment of specific sleep stages. As the use of wearable devices that are valid for the assessment of sleep increases in the general community, so too does the potential to answer research questions that were previously impractical or impossible to address—in some way, we could consider that the whole world is becoming a sleep laboratory.},

Historically, they have been primarily used either as environmental sensors to measure the atmospheric pressure for weather forecasts or as altimeters for aircrafts. With the advent of microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based barometers and their systematic embedding in smartphones and wearable devices, a vast breadth of new applications for the use of barometers has emerged. For instance, it is now possible to use barometers in conjunction with other sensors to track and identify a wide range of human activity classes. However, the effectiveness of barometers in the growing field of human activity recognition critically hinges on our understanding of the numerous factors affecting the atmospheric pressure, as well as on the properties of the sensor itself—sensitivity, accuracy, variability, etc. This review article thoroughly details all these factors and presents a comprehensive report of the numerous studies dealing with one or more of these factors in the particular framework of human activity tracking and recognition. In addition, we specifically collected some experimental data to illustrate the effects of these factors, which we observed to be in good agreement with the findings in the literature. We conclude this review with some suggestions on some possible future uses of barometric sensors for the specific purpose of tracking human activities.},

The EU Funded Unobtrusive Smart Environments for Independent Living (USEFIL) project is an assistive technology tool being developed to enhance independent living. As part of USEFIL, a wrist wearable unit (WWU) is being developed to monitor the physical activity (PA) of the user and integrate with the USEFIL system. The WWU is a novel application of an existing technology to the assisted living problem domain. It combines existing technologies and new algorithms to extract PA parameters for activity monitoring. The parameters that are extracted include: activity level, step count and worn state. The WWU, the algorithms that have been developed and a preliminary validation are presented. The results show that activity level can be successfully extracted, that worn state can be correctly identified and that step counts in walking data can be estimated within 3\% error, using the controlled dataset.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPG) is currently used to measure heart rate (HR) and the accuracy of PPG can be influenced by pigmentation of the skin; however, the effects of skin color-related artifacts on PPG during exercise remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the agreement between the Apple Watch photoplethysmography sensor and a criterion, for measuring heart rate across a range of intensities during exercise and to determine the influence of skin type on the accuracy of the measure. Forty-five males (20–43 y) completed the Fitzpatrick Skin Scale and were classified into three different skin type groups: a) types II (n = 15), III (n = 15) and IV (n = 15). Participants performed a graded incremental cycle-ergometer test while simultaneously wearing the Apple Watch and a Polar monitor as a criterion measure. Data from both devices were collected in 5-s epochs. Correlations between devices were very good (0.96–0.99 [95\%CI: 0.94 to 0.99]). Significant differences were observed between skin types II and III when the intensity of the exercise was increased, albeit with trivial to small effect sizes (ES: 0.05 to 0.28). All significant differences corresponded to {\textless}2\% of relative difference between both devices. Bland-Altman analyses showed a trivial but systematic underestimation of HR in the Apple Watch compared to Polar for all skin types during exercise. In conclusion, the Apple Watch accurately measures HR when cycling at different intensities and certain types of skin seem not to influence these measures, which may have important implications for controlling the intensity of exercise.},

	abstract = {As wearable technologies are being increasingly used for clinical research and healthcare, it is critical to understand their accuracy and determine how measurement errors may affect research conclusions and impact healthcare decision-making. Accuracy of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical method for measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in PPG stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts, and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and PPG data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during activity was, on average, 30\% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions using these devices.},
